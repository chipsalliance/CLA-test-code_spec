# CLA Onboarding Repo (Spec+code projects)

CHIPS Alliance requires all specification projects to accept contributions under a CLA and the OWFa. We use the EasyCLA tool to ensure that all contributors have signed the appropriate documents.

This is a neutral repo where you can open a trivial PR and initiate the [EasyCLA signing process](https://github.com/chipsalliance/tsc/tree/main/cla) for projects that produce **both specs and code**. Please note that you can use this repo to sign the documents in advance, or you can skip straight to opening a PR against a project. Either way you will be directed through the same signing process.

Please also note there is a separate CLA for contributions to projects that produce only source code. If you plan to contribute to **code-only** projects, you should also open a PR against the other [onboarding repo](https://github.com/chipsalliance/EasyCLA-code_only) and complete the full signing process.

Once you have signed as an individual or been added to your company's approved contributors list you will not be prompted to sign the CLA+OWFa again.

 1. Open the pull request.
 1. Your PR should be blocked. Click Details to be taken to EasyCLA.
 1. Follow the prompts as an individual, or on behalf of your company. If you're signing on behalf of your company, you should find out who can sign legal agreements, as well as who is allowed to say which developers are covered by the agreement.
 1. Once the CLA has been signed, you might need to close and re-open the PR to re-run the check. When you have a green checkmark, you're ready to go.
